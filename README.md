This is my 5th full stack application project for the Flatiron School.
The front end is written in React/Redux and the backend is written in Ruby on Rails.

Users can search the database for recipes, and save their favorite recipes to the app.
There is a saved recipes folder that allows you to sort recipes by serving size (yield),
and sort your saved recipes alphabetically.

The repo for the front end is https://github.com/m-gamao/recipe_app_frontend.git
